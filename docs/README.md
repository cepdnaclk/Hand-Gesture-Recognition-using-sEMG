## Abstract
Identifying hand gestures using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals is vital in the development of next-generation human-machine interfaces (HMI). sEMG based HMIs provide users with a more natural and convenient way to communicate with computing systems. sEMG signals recorded from muscle tissues give information about the intended muscle movements triggered by the brain waves. Identifying these movements allows developing interfaces that can control computing devices. In this research, an attempt was made to improve a hand gesture recognition model that could be used as a human-machine interface using an online open dataset of sEMG signals. First sEMG signals were preprocessed using a bandpass filter and notch filter to remove noises in the signal. Then various time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features extracted and they were fed into machine learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), and recurrent neural networks. All the results were validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Maximum testing accuracy of 90.03% was obtained using an SVM classifier with root mean square, mean frequency, and median frequency of the signal as features for 24 channel data. Later an attempt was also made to use this result to control a simple game developed in Unity using sEMG signals collected from an 8-channel signal acquisition device.

## Related works
Various approaches have been proposed in the area of EMG-based applications. As sEMG signals from different muscle groups exhibit different characteristics, different techniques have been employed to characterize muscle movement. But in general, it is all down to feature extraction to represent the signal as a vector of features, followed by feature selection to reduce the vectorâ€™s dimensionality, and finally, classification to determine each vector as belong to one of a fixed set of classes [5].
Paleari et al. [6] have used the root mean square (RMS) feature with a neural network model to classify hand movements using 192 channel high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) signals from the forearm. Stango et al. [7] have used the SVM classifier with variogram, which is a measure of the degree of spatial correlation to build a model to control upper limb prostheses using HD-sEMG signals. Liu et al. [8] proposed an invariant feature extraction (IFE) framework based on kernel fisher discriminant analysis to enhance the robustness of myoelectric pattern recognition. Tsai et al. [9] proposed multi-channel EMG-based motion pattern recognition. They have used the SVM classifier with STFT-ranking features based on short-time Fourier transform and principal component analysis to feature selection. Amma et al. [10] used HD-sEMG signals recorded by 192 electrodes to classify finger gestures using the RMS feature and a naive Bayes classifier. Most of these researches based on HD-sEMG signals and complex feature extraction with complex deep learning models that give higher accuracy are not suitable to implement in a real-time environment as they have higher latencies, expensive in terms of electrode configuration, and inconvenient for the user.
