   "description":"This research is focused on producing an improved hand gestures recognition model that could be useful to interact with machine interfaces using sEMG signals. Here an attempt was made to find computationally less expensive features with simple classifiers models to improve gesture recognition accuracies on an online open dataset of sEMG signals generated by muscle activations from forearm contraction. Later this study was extended to produce a real-time end user system that can be used in a real-world environment.",
