# Improved Gesture Recognition for sEMG based Human Machine Interface
## Group 10
Recognizing hand gestures that could be useful to interact with machine interfaces using sEMG signals generated by muscle activations from forearm contraction. And try to build a model that could be used in a real-time environment
